            <p>Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned park in Ontario is 
                a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine, moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square kilometers (3500 square 
                miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a diverse and unblemished eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth.<br><br>

                    <p>Algonquin Park & Area offers a variety of angling opportunities (Brook Trout,Lake Trout, Pike, Rainbow Trout, Bass, Walleye). The 
                        nutrient rich lakes and streams provide ideal habitat for sport fish species. Many lakes in the area are stocked in order to provide 
                        enhanced fishing opportunities to anglers. Each species of sport fish has a regulated open and closed season. Closed season is usually 
                        during the spawning period.

                    <h2 class="hidden">Algonquin Galeairy Lake</h2>
                    <p>Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with direct access to Algonquin Park. Originally named Long lake which was 
                        renamed to Galeairy Lake because the lake borders Nightengale and Airy townships.<br><br>

                        Galeairy Lake is 11 kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and extends mostly inside the boundaries of Algonquin Park . Explore the 
                        many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons, beaver, otter and moose. Pull up on shore, have a picnic and go for a 
                        swim.<br><br>
                        
                        Swimming in this lake is great. It is very clean and safe, with water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by the end of July. Typically 
                        the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third week of June to the first week of September.

                    <p>Spring is in the air and life in Nature is coming alive with excitement here at Algonquin Park, a perfect time to take a romantic 
                        vacation at Couples Resort and visit Algonquin Park.<br><br>

                        Weather here in the spring can often be several degrees warmer than if you live near places like Lake Ontario as the ground here can 
                        warm up fast and we have no big Lake effect keeping air cool. Here you can enjoy outdoor hiking plus many other sports and 
                        attractions.<br><br>
                        
                        Whether you are a couple that wants to find that special time together uninterrupted or as a gift to someone special in your life, this 
                        experience will bring you closer together, and that is what life is all about.<br><br>
                        
                        The resort sits at the edge of a tiny Village, Whitney, and on a gorgeous Algonquin Park Lake, Galeairy Lake. This Lake is 11 km long, 
                        Semi-Private and 95% undeveloped so it is great for discovering hidden bays and exploring what nature has to offer along the 
                        shorelines.<br><br>
                        
                        Couples Resort is All-Inclusive and you will enjoy romantic gourmet dinners and breakfasts in bed. Includes: Canoe, Kayak, Tennis, 
                        Mountain Bike and Hike the many trails.

                        Spring offers the year's best Moose viewing and you typically don't have to search very hard to see Moose. The application of salt to 
                        Highway 60 during winter road maintenance operations, attracts Moose to roadside ditches.<br>
                        We provide clothing to keep you warm and dry, includes 100% windproof & waterproof pants and jackets plus polar fleece interiors, if 
                        needed. We recommend that you bring good hiking shoes.<br><br>
                        
                        We provide free passes into Algonquin Park with your stay with us.<br>
                        Algonquin Park's two museums, the Visitor Centre and Logging Museum, are open daily (see the Events Calendar for specific operating 
                        dates and hours) offering all visitors park information, plus outstanding natural and cultural history exhibits.<br><br>
                        
                        From late April into May, a select group of wildflowers called “spring ephemerals” grow and bloom in the brief window between the 
                        spring snow melt and leaf-out of the overhead canopy of trees. Once the canopy has filled in, very little light reaches the forest 
                        floor and many of these wildflowers go into dormancy until the next year, staying alive as a rootstock underground.

                    <p>Fall is an idyllic time to take a romantic getaway at the Couples Resort and visit Algonquin Park, Muskoka.  Summer has given way 
                        to brisk, invigorating autumn air.  Fall days remain long, making it comfortable to stay outside for long periods and to enjoy 
                        perfect walking and hiking conditions on an endless system of trails.<br><br>

                        Nothing says FALL more than fall colors in Algonquin Park, which is known to have some of the most brilliant changes of 
                        season throughout Ontario. Considered a Signature Canadian Experience bringing visitors from around the world, who are attracted 
                        by the outstanding fall colour viewing opportunities, but there are many other things to see and do.

                        along lakes.   Total length 150 km if you go 75 km on the Right side of the Road on the way out and back on the left side of the Road 
                        on the way back.  But if you go 1 km out and 1 km back that is good to start for many of us.
